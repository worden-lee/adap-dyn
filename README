adap-dyn library by Lee Worden
Base classes for evolutionary ecology simulations.

Requires VXL, Sundials, maybe MPI, though it may be possible to 
compile without them.  to do: make these things truly optional.

This used to be known as adap-dyn2 - there was another adap-dyn
before that.  Some of that is in a CVS repository, but nobody
needs it.
